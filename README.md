An analysis using ML on measuring Hate Crimes in India. Replication of freely available data on Kaggle.

1. **Introduction:**
   - Recognized hate crimes as a significant societal concern in India.
   - Set the objective to analyze the root causes and potential mitigating factors.
   - Introduced the dataset, research objectives, and methodologies used.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Selected relevant predictor variables (crime types) and the outcome variable (total hate crimes).
   - Explored, cleaned, and prepared the dataset, ensuring data quality.

3. **Stratified K-fold Cross-Validation:**
   - Employed stratified K-fold cross-validation to assess model performance.
   - Considered the impact of regional disparities on hate crime reporting.
   - Calculated Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a measure of model accuracy.

4. **Bootstrapping Analysis:**
   - Utilized bootstrapping to assess the stability of models.
   - Addressed potential sources of bias and variability.
   - Investigated the causal relationship between specific crime types and hate crimes.

5. **Bad Controls:**
   - Introduced bad controls to assess the impact of omitted variables on model estimates.
   - Highlighted the importance of comprehensive model specification.

6. **Omitted Variable Bias:**
   - Analyzed the consequences of omitting relevant variables from regression models.
   - Demonstrated improved model accuracy through comprehensive model specification.

7. **Neural Networks:**

   - Overcame convergence issues with the aid of MLPRegressor.
   - Compared the results of the Neural Network model to traditional regression models.

8. **Policy Implications:**
   - Provided insights for policymakers, emphasizing the significance of targeted policies.
   - Highlighted the importance of considering regional disparities in policy planning.

9. **Data Quality and Future Research:**
   - Acknowledged the importance of data quality in hate crime analysis.
   - Encouraged future research to explore additional factors and advanced techniques.

10. **Overall Conclusion and Reflections:**
    - Summarized the findings and reflections from the various analyses.
    - Emphasized the value of diverse analytical techniques and comprehensive model specification in understanding and addressing hate crimes in India.

11. **Summary of Key Points:**
    - Hate crimes in India are a significant societal concern with complex causes.
    - Stratified K-fold cross-validation assesses model performance, considering regional disparities.
    - Bootstrapping enhances model stability and identifies potential bias sources.
